            <p> These are some of the soups I also enjoy making! Soups are one of my favorite things to make; it’s always fun throwing together random things and seeing what the final product is. 
                I also love freezing soup when I make too much. It makes for a fast meal later when I don’t have time to cook anything.

                        I learned to make soy milk from scratch with my mom. 
                        While it is a lot more labor-intensive than buying soymilk from the grocery store, drinking a glass of fresh soy milk after soaking, grinding, straining, and cooking for what felt like forever was very rewarding.

                    A rotisserie chicken from Costco leads to many opportunities in the kitchen, and chicken soup is one of my favorites. 
                    I took the carcass of the chicken after shredding the meat off of the bones and boiled it in chicken stock for a few hours after sautéing some carrots, onion, and celery. Adding back in the chicken meat led to a very yummy and filling soup.

                    My mom makes homemade kimchi often. Using some of that kimchi to make kimchi stew is always very convenient, as kimchi has a lot of flavor that lends well to a quick and easy stew. Simply fry the kimchi in sesame oil, add some onions, garlic, meat, and then add water, and the soup is done! I also like to add tofu.

                    While this recipe did not result from using a rotisserie chicken, the flavor and taste were still delicious. I used leftover bones from chicken thighs that I de-boned to make a basic stock along with carrots, onion, and celery, to ultimately create a cream soup full of chicken, veggies, and noodles. 
                    While thinner in consistency, half and half can sometimes be a lot more affordable than heavy whipping cream, and still added a delicious creaminess to the soup!

                    Broccoli cheddar soup is one of my favorite soups of all time. The creaminess and richness of the soup are always very comforting, and the broccoli and carrots make it feel healthy (despite all the butter and cream….) Using a cast iron pot has helped to prevent the separation of the liquid and milky parts.

                    This is one of the many soups I have created after combining random ingredients I could find in my fridge. I first began by sautéing onions, chicken sausage, carrots, and garlic together. I didn’t have pre-made stock at the time and also did not feel like making my own, so I instead added tomato paste to add some flavor as well as some chicken bouillon cubes along with water. The soup turned out surprisingly flavorful and is now one of my go-to soups to make.
