        <h2>Website Introduction and Accessibility Features</h2>
        <p> No pre-made templates were used when creating this website; all of the designs, content, and layout of the website were hand-coded or designed by me! While this website is still in its infancy and is still relatively simple, it is a great opportunity for me to practice my HTML and CSS knowledge. As my cooking experiences grow, I will also work to elevate this site.
            <br>
            <br>
            Additionally, ensuring that designs are catered to the experiences and needs of a wide range of individuals is crucial to ensuring that technology is accessible.
            <br> 
            <br>
            Despite this website's simple nature, this website was designed with accessibility in mind, and I have coded and designed its features and designs to be centered around accessible design. Please read on below to learn about these characteristics.

        <div class="info_box">
            <h4>Screen Reader and Keyboard User Friendly</h4>
            <p>Many users rely on screen-readers or keyboards to navigate through websites. Accessible designs and features are therefore especially crucial for the experiences of these users due to the need to ensure that they can access the same pieces of information
                <br>
                <br>
                Each image is embedded with alternate text describing the image; users using screen readers or keyboards to navigate the website can listen to this alternate text (with the additional help of text-to-speech already on their devices) to know what the picture is describing. 
            </p>

          <div class="info_box">
            <h4>Mobile First Design</h4>
            <p>In mobile-first design, we prioritize the design of smaller screens before beginning to design interfaces for larger screens. Designing for smaller screens is crucial to accessibility; many individuals primarily use smaller screens and centering their experiences is crucial to making designs that work for a wide range of people.
                <br>
                <br>
                This website accommodates 3 sizes of screens: mobile devices (screens below 600 pixels, tablets (screens between 600 and 768 pixels), and desktops (screens greater than 768 pixels). The layout for each of these views is different. See below!

            <h4>Color Contrast</h4>
            <p>Color contrast is crucial to design in that users are able to effectively distinguish features, text, or designs from each other. For uses with vision impairments or low vision, color contrast is even more important.
                <br>
                <br>
                The color palettes featured on each page were created with help from Venngage, an accessible color palette generator. Additionally, each page of this website passed the AXE Dev Tools validation test, an online test that ensures a website adheres to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.
