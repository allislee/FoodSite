                    Tomato egg was one of the first dishes I learned to make growing up. 
                    It is a very popular dish in Taiwanese and Chinese cuisine, and there are many ways to elevate it, whether it be turning it into a soup, or simply eating it with rice. 
                    Despite being so simple to make, it is extremely delicious and I have cooked it countless times throughout the semesters when I need a quick and easy meal.

                Chicken thighs were one of the first meats I learned how to cook and are always convenient when I want to eat something filling but not too difficult to cook as they are very difficult to overcook. 
                These are first marinated in soy sauce, salt, pepper, and garlic, and then coated with cornstarch. 
                After frying until crispy, remove from the pan and begin making the sauce by adding garlic, oyster sauce, soy sauce, sugar, and water!

                    Requiring no cooking or heat, salads were made very often when I wanted something healthy yet simple to make. 
                    I always added chickpeas, tomatoes, green onions, and bell peppers into mine! I often used ranch, but when I was feeling a bit more healthy, I would make a homemade dressing.

                    During my time in college, canned chickpeas were often a lifesaver due to their convenience and nutrition. 
                    This recipe resulted from compiling chickpeas, onions, and other leftover spices and vegetables I could find.

                    Growing up, whenever my family ate spaghetti, it was always using tomato sauce from the jar.
                    While it was delicious and brings back very fond memories, I wanted to try making spaghetti sauce from scratch. 
                    Being surprisingly easy to cook, spaghetti was a dish I made often throughout college as it often required a singular pot only, meaning cleanup was quick and easy. 
                    Sometimes I added ground beef, and sometimes I made left it simple with only vegetables.

                Bok choy is one of my all-time favorite vegetables, and when paired with beef, it makes for a very filling and yummy meal. 
                Sha cha sauce is widely used in Taiwanese/Chinese cuisine made from dried seafood, shallots, garlic, and other things. 
                I love the flavor of sha cha sauce so much, and have been eating it since I was little; adding the sauce to beef and bok choy makes it much more delicious (in my opinion).

                    Instead of minced pork, my mother began to use minced chicken when my sister stopped eating red meat. Using ground chicken and the same ingredients for traditional minced pork rice, we made minced chicken instead, which tastes just as yummy. Eating it with noodles was very convenient when I ran out of rice at my apartment or did not have time to steam rice!

                    Eggplants are one of my favorite vegetables ever and learning how to cook them myself has been life changing. 
                    This dish requires coating the eggplant with cornstarch first, and while that is sitting, frying various aromatics for the sauce. 
                    It can use a lot of oil, so I have also found that steaming the eggplants first makes it feel a bit healthier.
